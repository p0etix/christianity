<br>
Blessed are the temperate, for God will reveal himself to them.
<br>
Blessed are they that abandon their secular enjoyments, for they shall be accepted of God.
<br>
Blessed are they who have wives, as though they had them not, for they shall be made angels of God.
<br>
Blessed are they who tremble at the word of God, for they shall be comforted.
<br>
Blessed are they who keep their baptism pure, for they shall find peace with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
<br>
Blessed are they who pursue the doctrine of Jesus Christ, for they shall be called the sons of the Most High.
<br>
Blessed are they who observe the instructions of Jesus Christ, for they shall dwell in eternal light.
<br>
Blessed are they, who for the love of Christ abandon the glories of the world, for they shall judge angels, and be placed at the right hand of Christ, and shall not suffer the bitterness of the last judgment.
<br>
Blessed are the bodies and souls of virgins, for they are acceptable to God and shall not lose the reward of their virginity, for the word of their Father shall prove effectual to their salvation in the day of his Son, and they shall enjoy rest forevermore.

While Paul was preaching this sermon in the church which was in the house of Onesiphorus, a certain virgin named Thecla (whose mother's name was Theoclia, and who was betrothed to a man named Thamyris) sat at a certain window in her house. From where, by the advantage of a window in the house where Paul was, she both night and day heard Paul's sermons concerning God, concerning charity, concerning faith in Christ, and concerning prayer; Nor would she depart from the window till with exceeding joy she was subdued to the doctrines of faith.
